PRI-Class-Router
================
This is  our project from HackRPI from NRB 2014, RPI Class Router.
There is a GithHub project for it at https://github.com/mvrablik/RPI-Class-Router.
It allows users to enter CRNs, checks their validity, and then plots a
selected day's route from class to class (in chronological order) on the
standard RPI campus map.  The group Members were Michael Vrablik, Aaron Perl,
and Gwen Diebold.
